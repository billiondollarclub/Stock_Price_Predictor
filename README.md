(Develop Stock Predictive Models using Deep Learning that extract valuable insights from 5-year historical stock dataset)

• Performed EDA to visualize temporal trends, applied MinMax scaling to normalize data and 50-day sliding window for optimal model fit

• Devoloped LSTM RNN utilizing Augmented Dickey-Fuller(ADF) to verify stationarity, Ljung-Box test for absent residual autocorrelation

• Achieved RMSE of 2.86 showing high predictive accuracy validating model’s effectiveness in capturing real-world market fluctuations
